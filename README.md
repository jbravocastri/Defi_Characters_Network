# Defi_Characters_Network
Creating character networks from stories like Asimov's "Foundation" is a big challenge in NLP. Three key stages :  identifying characters, detecting their interactions, and constructing the relational graph.

# Run freeling using docker, creating a freeling image from the instructions given in https://github.com/TALP-UPC/FreeLing/tree/master/APIs/docker. 
This link contains the needed files to run freeling under dockers.

The code (tp_intro.ipynb, using Jupyter Notebook) includes a 'Run_terminal' function that executes FreeLing via Docker (docker run -i --rm  freeling analyze -f fr.cfg <input.txt >output.txt).
